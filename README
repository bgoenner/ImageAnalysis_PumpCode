# Image Analysis code

This code was developed to work with a Ismatec 24 channel 
pump and pneumatic solenoid array that controlled a set of 
microvalves.

The main code would simultaniously communicate with the 
physical systems and process imput from a cammera. The 
program will initialize as a terminal program that can 
process the image while the system is running or read in 
already recorded video for verifying or to perform the 
processing after testing.
